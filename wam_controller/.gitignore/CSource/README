Inverse Kinematics
    Files:
     ikine7DOF.c

    Description:
     ROS C code that perfoms inverse kinematics for the WAM.  It returns the solution
     that is "nearest" to the current solution.
    
    To Build:
     mex ikine7DOF.c

    Be sure to copy resulting file (likely named "ikine7DOF.mexw32") to the WAM7DOF directory


RNE
    Files:
     frne.c
     ne.c
     vmath.c
     frne.h
     ne.h

    Description:
        C code that computes Inverse Dynamics using Recursive Newton Euler
    
    To Build:
        mex frne.c ne.c vmath.c

    Be sure to copy resulting file (likely named "frne.mexw32") to the WAM7DOF directory
