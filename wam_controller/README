Matlab/xPC Target Controller for Barrett WAM
RPI Computer Science Robotics Lab

This contains all of the files that are needed for running our WAM using MATLAB and xPC target. The main components of the system are the WAM
itself and a 9-camera NaturalPoint OptiTrack tracking system.

A terse overview:
  wamjc7.mdl           - The actual controller model. Contains a joint space controller, a Jacobian based cartesian space controller and an
                         impedance controller. Also does contact detection using the Force/Torque sensor on the WAM and force reading from the
                         fingers of a Schunk WSG50 Parallel jaw gripper.
  ArmCommands          - Contains functions to send command for all types of motion to the arm
  BarretHandCommands   - Contains functions to send command to the Barrett Hand (BH260)
  CSource              - C code that is mostly oriented towards running inverse kinematics and dynamics for the WAM
  DatabaseCommands     - Contains funtions to read and write to the Experiments Database
  ExperimentCallbacks  - Callback functions for running actual experiments
  ORUtils              - Utilities to interface OpenRave with Matlab for displaying trajectories prior to execution
  TCPIPToolbox         - A TCPIP toolbox (used for one of our projects, not directly needed for running the WAM)
  TrajectoryGeneration - Contains code that is used for trajectory generation, both jointspace and Cartesian space
